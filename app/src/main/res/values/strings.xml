        These Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, the Mobile Devices Terms and all policies site set out the terms on which we offer you access to and use of our site, services, applications and tools (collectively "services").

<strong>Abusing Uni Services</strong><br>
Please use the flagging system to tell us about any problems or offensive content so that together we can keep the Services site working properly. We may limit or terminate our Services, remove hosted content and take technical and legal steps to keep users off Uni if we think that they are creating problems or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies. However, whether we decide to take any of these steps, remove hosted content or keep a user off Uni or not, we do not accept any liability for monitoring Uni or for unauthorized or unlawful content on Uni or use of Uni. by users.<br><br>

<strong>Posting</strong><br>
We reserve the right to limit the amount of posts a user may make in an individual category or overall on Uni. Any attempts to post an amount exceeding a set limit may be deemed as spam and/or an unreasonable load on our infrastructure. <br><br>

<strong>Fees and Services</strong><br>
We may charge fees for certain Services. If the service you use charges a fee, you will be able to review and accept that charge. Our fees are quoted in Canadian Dollars, and we may change them from time to time. We will notify you of changes to our fee policy by posting such changes on the site. We may choose to temporarily change our fees for promotional events or new services; these changes are effective when we announce the promotional event or new service. Our fees are non-refundable, and you are responsible for paying them when they\'re due. If you don\'t, we may limit your ability to use the Services. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms.<br><br>

<strong>Content</strong><br>
Uni Services contains content from Uni Software Productions Inc., you, and other users. You agree not to copy, modify, or distribute Uni, its services, our copyrights trademarks, or intellectual property associated with Uni. When you give us content, you are granting us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable right to exercise the copyright, publicity, and database rights to that content. If you believe that your rights have been violated, please notify us at the designated contact point contact@unisoftwareproductions.ca and we will investigate the matter. We reserve the right to remove content where we have grounds for suspecting the violation of these terms or the rights of any other party.<br><br>

<strong>Reporting Intellectual Property Infringements</strong><br>
Do not post content that infringes the rights of third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, content that infringes on intellectual property rights such as copyright and trademark (e.g. offering counterfeit items for sale). We reserve the right to remove content where we have grounds for suspecting the violation of these terms, our policies or of any party\'s rights. The following steps are for reporting a listing to Uni Software Productions Inc. that you believe to be infringing on your intellectual property rights. Only the intellectual property rights owner can report of potentially infringing items or listings. If you have a good faith belief that a listing on any of the Uni Services infringes your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, all you need to do is contact Uni Software Productions Inc. at the designated contact point contact@unisoftwareproductions.ca. We reserve the right to share, in accordance with applicable law, the completed complaint with the third party that originally posted the potentially infringing listing.<br><br>

<strong>Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</strong><br>
The Uni Services are provided “as is” and “as available”. You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do. As most of the stuff on the Uni Services comes from other users, we do not guarantee the accuracy of postings or user communications or the quality, safety, or legality of what is offered. We also cannot guarantee continuous or secure access to our Services. Notification functionality in our Services may not occur in real time. Such functionality is subject to delays beyond our control, including without limitation, delays or latency due to your physical location or your wireless data service provider’s network. Accordingly, to the extent legally permitted we expressly disclaim all warranties, representations and conditions, express or implied, including those of quality, merchantability, merchantable quality, durability, fitness for a particular purpose and those arising by statute. We are not liable for any loss, whether of money (including profit), goodwill, or reputation, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of your use of Uni, even if you advise us or we could reasonably foresee the possibility of any such damage occurring. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.<br><br>

Despite the previous paragraph, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or any third party (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability in tort, by statute or otherwise) is limited to the greater of (a) the total fees you pay to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to liability, or (b) 100 Canadian Dollars.<br><br>

<strong>Indemnification</strong><br>
You will indemnify and hold harmless Uni Software Productions Inc. and its affiliates and our and their respective officers, directors, agents and employees (each an “Indemnified Party”), from any claim made by any third party, together with any amounts payable to the third party whether in settlement or as may otherwise be awarded, and reasonable legal costs incurred by any of the Indemnified Parties, arising from or relating to your use of the Uni services, any alleged violation by you of the applicable terms, and any alleged violation by you of any applicable law or regulation. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, but doing so will not excuse your indemnity obligations.<br><br>

<strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
By using Uni Software Productions Inc., you agree to the collection, transfer, storage and use of information you provide on Uni by Uni Software Productions Inc. (the "data controller") on servers located in Canada as further described in our privacy policy.<br><br>

<strong>General</strong><br>
These terms and the other policies posted on Uni constitute the entire agreement between Uni Software Productions Inc. and you, superseding any prior agreements. This agreement is governed by the laws of Canada. We both submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Canada. This will not affect your statutory rights if you are a consumer and applicable consumer law requires application of another law (such as the law of your country of residence) for certain topics. If we don\'t enforce any particular provision, we are not waiving our right to do so later. If a court strikes down any of these terms, the remaining terms will survive. We may automatically assign this agreement in our sole discretion in accordance with the notice provision below. Except for notices relating to illegal or infringing content, your notices to us must be sent by registered mail to:<br><br>

Uni Software Productions<br>
Suite 3003, Bruneau Centre for Research and Innovation, Memorial University of Newfoundland<br>
P.O. Box 4200<br>

Re: Uni: User Inquiries<br><br>

No other amendment to this agreement will be effective unless made in writing, signed by users and by us. <br><br>

<strong>Mobile Devices Terms</strong><br>
If you\'re accessing Uni from a mobile device using a Uni Mobile Application (the "Application"), the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Use") apply to you in addition to the applicable Mobile Privacy and Legal Notice or End User License Agreement, as the case may be. Your use of the Application confirms your agreement to these Terms of Use.<br><br>
